# Manual-SQA-Projects
This repository contains the practical assignments I completed during my SQA (Software Quality Assurance) course. Throughout the course, I worked on various manual testing projects that helped me build a solid foundation in software testing methodologies. Each folder represents a different project where I applied diverse testing techniques, including:

**Test Case Design**

**Bug Reporting and Tracking**

**Regression Testing**

**Functional and Non-Functional Testing**

**Test Plan and Strategy Development (where applicable)**

Though some projects may not include full documentation, they reflect my hands-on experience with manual SQA practices. This repository highlights my commitment to understanding and practicing key concepts in software testing, which I am eager to apply in a professional setting.
